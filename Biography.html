        Franklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), often referred to by his initials FDR, 
        was an American politician and attorney who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933
        until his death in 1945. As a member of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections 
        and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed 
        the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in 
        response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the 
        New Deal Coalition, which defined modern liberalism in the United States throughout the middle third of the 
        20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, which ended shortly after he died 
        in office.

    Born into the Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, 
    and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, 
    he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into 
    adulthood. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
    under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's 
    1920 national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic 
    illness, believed at the time to be polio, and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from 
    his condition, Roosevelt founded a polio rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Although unable to walk 
    unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office after his election as governor of New York in 1928. He served as governor 
    from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States.

    In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover in a landslide. The 
    Roosevelt presidency began in the midst of the Great Depression and during the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. 
    Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation. He also issued a profusion of executive orders that 
    instituted the New Deal—a variety of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. He created numerous 
    programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery 
    Administration and other agencies. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, 
    and labor. In addition to the economy Roosevelt also sought to curtail the rising crime brought about because of 
    Prohibition.[2] After campaigning on a platform to repeal it, Roosevelt implemented the Beer Permit Act and enforced 
    the 21st amendment. He used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 "fireside chat" radio addresses 
    during his presidency and became the first American president to be televised. The economy improved rapidly from 1933 
    to 1936, and Roosevelt won a landslide reelection in 1936. After the election, he sought passage of the Judicial 
    Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (or "court packing plan"), intending to expand the size of the Supreme Court. The bill 
    was blocked by the newly formed bipartisan Conservative Coalition which also sought to prevent further New Deal 
    legislation, as a result the economy began to decline which lead to the recession of 1937–1938. Other major 1930s 
    legislation and agencies implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National 
    Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Social Security, and the Fair Labor Standards Act.

    He was reelected in 1940 for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. 
    By 1939 another World War was on the horizon which prompted the United States to respond by passing a series of laws 
    affirming neutrality and rejecting intervention. Despite this President Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial 
    support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 
    on December 7, 1941, an event he called "a date which will live in infamy", Roosevelt obtained a congressional 
    declaration of war against Japan. On December 11th Japan's allies, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the 
    United States. In response the US formally joined the Allies and entered the European theater of war. Assisted by his 
    top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston 
    Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied 
    Powers against the Axis Powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort 
    and implemented a Europe first strategy, initiating the Lend-Lease program and making the defeat of Germany first a 
    priority over that of Japan. His administration oversaw the construction of The Pentagon, initiated the development 
    of the world's first atomic bomb, and worked with other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations 
    and other post-war institutions. It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on 
    the world stage.

    Roosevelt won reelection in the 1944 presidential election on his post-war recovery platform. His physical health 
    began declining during the later war years, and less than three months into his fourth term, Roosevelt died on 
    April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed office as president and oversaw the acceptance of surrender 
    by the Axis powers. Some of Roosevelt's actions have faced substantial criticism, such as his ordering of the 
    relocation and internment of Japanese Americans. Nevertheless, he is consistently ranked by scholars, political 
    scientists, and historians as being among the nation's three greatest presidents, alongside George Washington and 
    Abraham Lincoln.
